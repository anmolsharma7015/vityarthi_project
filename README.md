# To_Do List

## Introduction:

A simple and beginner-friendly Command Line To-Do List written in Python.
This program allows users to add, edit, delete, and list tasks easily using a simple menu-driven interface.

## Features:

**Add Tasks:** Users can input any task which gets stored in a list.

**Edit Existing Tasks:** Update tasks by selecting them using their index number.

**Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list using their index.

**List Tasks:** Display all current tasks with index numbers.

**Interactive Menu Loop:** The program keeps running until the user chooses to exit.

## How It Works:

**add_task():** Adds a new task

**edit_task():** Edits an existing task

**delete_task():** Deletes a selected task

**list_tasks():** Shows all tasks

**menu():** Displays the main menu

**A while True:** loop keeps showing the menu until the program is manually exited.

## How to Run:

**1.** Make sure Python is installed on your system.


**2.** Save the code as todo.py


**3.** Open terminal or command prompt.


**4.** Run the script:
```
 python todo.py:
```
The menu will appear, and you can start managing tasks.
