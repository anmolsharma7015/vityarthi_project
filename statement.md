# Project Statement: To-Do List

## 1. The Problem
People tend to forget the tasks they have at end, so they need a visual list to keep it in their mind, but most apps are too complicated. They require accounts, internet access, or have too many confusing buttons.

## 2. Project Scope
This project is a simple CLI-based tool that gives you the option to personalize your own to-do list.

**What it does (In-Scope):**
* **Runs in the Terminal:** A text-based interface (CLI) that is fast and lightweight.
* **The Essentials:** You can Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
* **Temporary Focus:** It uses "in-memory" storage, meaning tasks reset when you close the program.
* **Error Handling:** It ensures the app doesn't crash if you type the wrong number.

**What comes later (Future Plans):**
* Saving tasks to a file or database so they persist after closing.
* A graphical interface (windows and buttons).
* Deadlines, reminders, and user logins.

## 3. Target Users
* **Students:** For tracking homework or study topics distraction-free.
* **Minimalists:** People who prefer simple tools over complex software.

## 4. Key Features
The app uses a simple numbered menu to control everything:

1.  **View Tasks:** See everything on your list with a simple index number.
2.  **Add Tasks:** Add a task to your list
3.  **Edit Tasks:** Change your task
4.  **Delete Tasks:** Remove the task from the list
5.  **Exit:** Close the app.
